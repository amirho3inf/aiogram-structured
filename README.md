# aiogram-structured
This is a structure for bot development with aiogram which I personally use. Indeed, I made this to speed up the development process of my own bots, do wtf you want with it <3

## ready to use tools
- SQLAlchemy (for database)
- Redis (for cache)
- APScheduler (for jobs)
- Context (separate file for texts, multi-language support)

## example
There's user model, example jobs and handlers for user registration already implemented in this repository that you can check and run. so don't forget to delete them when you start your project.

## how to use
clone the repository, install requirements, create config file and execute `./bot.py --help`.
